abstract="Conservation of the adiabatic invariants M (1.38) and J (2.36) holds under the condition that fields and external forces change only very little during a cyclotron period (1.30) and a bounce period (2.43), respectively. In Chapter II we have discussed the implications of the conservation of J for static cases only. In this Chapter we shall examine explicitly the effect of time variations of the magnetic field on particle drift shells.",
