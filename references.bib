In Chapter II we have discussed the implications of the conservation of J for static cases only. In this Chapter we shall examine explicitly the effect of time variations of the magnetic field on particle drift shells.",

We derive new collocation-type methods to solve the distributed control problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions and also discuss the Neumann boundary control problem, both involving Poisson's equation. We prove results concerning invertibility of the matrix systems we generate, and discuss a modification to guarantee invertibility. We implement these methods using Matlab, and produce numerical results to demonstrate the methods' capability. We also comment on the methods' effectiveness in comparison to the widely-used finite element formulation of the problem, and make some recommendations as to how this work may be extended.",

title="A Radial Basis Function Partition of Unity Collocation Method for Convection--Diffusion Equations Arising in Financial Applications",

abstract="Meshfree methods based on radial basis function (RBF) approximation are of interest for numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) because they are flexible with respect to geometry, they can provide high order convergence, they allow for local refinement, and they are easy to implement in higher dimensions. For global RBF methods, one of the major disadvantages is the computational cost associated with the dense linear systems that arise. Therefore, research is currently directed towards localized RBF approximations such as the RBF partition of unity collocation method (RBF--PUM) proposed here. The objective of this paper is to establish that RBF--PUM is viable for parabolic PDEs of convection--diffusion type. The stability and accuracy of RBF--PUM is investigated partly theoretically and partly numerically. Numerical experiments show that high-order algebraic convergence can be achieved for convection--diffusion problems. Numerical comparisons with finite difference and pseudospectral methods have been performed, showing that RBF--PUM is competitive with respect to accuracy, and in some cases also with respect to computational time. As an application, RBF--PUM is employed for a two-dimensional American option pricing problem. It is shown that using a node layout that captures the solution features improves the accuracy significantly compared with a uniform node distribution.",

In order to be competitive for very large scale simulations, the RBF–FD methods needs to be efficiently implemented for modern multicore based computer architectures. This is a challenging assignment, because the main computational operations are unstructured sparse matrix–vector multiplications, which in general scale poorly on multicore computers due to bandwidth limitations. However, with the task parallel implementation described here we achieve 60–100% of theoretical speedup within a shared memory node, and 80–100% of linear speedup across nodes. We present results for global shallow water benchmark problems with a 30 km resolution. "
